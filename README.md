# IT-250-Project
This project includes infromation about The Sleuth Kit and Digital Forensics, with a demo of the analysis of a E01 file. I used 4 command-line tools, including img_stat, fls, mmls, and fssat.
My goal is to not only allow myself to gather a better understanding on how to use The Sleuth Kit, but to also help others use basic commands and have a better understanding on what is displayed when said commands are used. 

While the assignment I have attached is not related to The Sleuth Kit, it relates to digtial forensics and the use of wireshark.

This assignment I have provided displays my understanding of wireshark and how to capture, view, and analyze packets.
